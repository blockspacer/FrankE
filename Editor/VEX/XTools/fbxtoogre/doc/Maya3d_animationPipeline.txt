Animation Pipeline for Maya and OgreMax in to Ogre
==================================================
by MrFigaro

+ Pre-Requisites:
    + Install Maya
    + Install OgreMax (http://www.ogremax.com/downloads)

+ Model the character:
    + Start with an empty maya file, e.g. Demon.mb
    + Model the character using polygons.
    + Texture it.
        + The textures must be referred to relative to the maya file.  
        + The textures must exist in the resource.cfg, with the same relative path.
        + The easiest way to do this is to have the textures in the same folder as the maya and output files.
    + Add a skeleton if required.
        + The model MUST be skinned with soft bind skin ([Animation]->Skin->Bind Skin->Soft Bind).
    + Create a Character Set.
        + Select the mesh and ALL the bones (not just the top bone).
        + [Animation]->Character->Create Character Set.
        
+ Create an animation:
    + In a SEPERATE Maya file (e.g Walk.mb or Run.mb), add a REFERENCE to the model file:
        + File->Create Reference
    + Animate the skeleton.  I think the animation needs to BAKED in, as animation clips need key frames before they can export.  
        + This is only a problem if IK or other such animation helpers have been rigged up to the skeleton.
        + There may be a way around this if you add any rig to the character set?  Needs experimenting with.
    + When ready, export an Animation Clip:
        + Select the Character Set
        + Open the Trax Editor (Window->Animation Editors->Trax Editor)
        + Create an Animation Clip (Create->Animation Clip)
            + A clip of your animation should appear in the timeline.
        + Name the clip to be the same name as your animation.
        + Select the clip in the Trax Editor.
        + Export it to the same file name as your animation, but with a .ma extension. (File->Export Animation Clip...)
    
+ Export the model and animations:
    + Create an empty Maya file for collecting the animations together, e.g. DemonAnimations.mb
    + Add a REFERENCE to the model file (File->Create Reference)
    + Open the Trax Editor (Window->Animation Editors->Trax Editor)
    + Create a track for the character (Create->Animation Clip)
        + This will not insert anything (and will moan about no keys being set, but ignore this - // Error: No clip created since character has no keys.)
    + Import all the animations:
        + File->Import Animation Clip To Characters...
        + Add the Animation Clips (e.g. Walk.ma, Run.ma)
    + Spread the animation clips out along the time line.
        + DO NOT let them overlap or even but up against each other, otherwise the animations will "bleed" in to each other.  Leave a gap.
    + Add the animation entries to the mesh object OgreMax data.
        + Select the mesh.
        + OgreMax->Object Settings...
            + Select the Mesh Animations tab
                + Mesh Animation Type: Skeleton
                + Export Skeleton: Yes
                + Export Animations to Seperate Skeleton Files: FALSE
            + For each animation clip in the trax editor, press the Add... button
                + Set the name (e.g. Walk, Run)
                + Set the Start/End frames, as displayed in the Trax Editor for the clip (bottom left and right values)
    + Once all the animations are in the list, you can export the model:
        + Select the mesh.
        + OgreMax->Export->Export Selected Objects...
        + Choose a FileName (e.g. Demon.mesh)
        + Save as type: OgreMax mesh (*.mesh)
    
+ Import character in to Ogre:
    + The export process will have generated a .mesh, .skeleton and a .material file.
    + Copy these and any textures in to the Resources folder.  You could zip them first, e.g. Demon.zip
    + Add a reference to the files in the resources.cfg file.
    + The mesh should now be available in the game, and all the animations should be useable.
